        Provides a list of all downstream builds for the provided build. If no
        build is provided, then current build is used.

        <b>Note:</b> If the downstream cache recently has been cleaned, or
        Jenkins recently has been restarted, then this method might give
        incomplete results! This behaviour might change in the future, without
        prior notice.
